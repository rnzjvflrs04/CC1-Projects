    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Beaches are what tourists come to the Maldives for, but you need to ask yourself what type of beach holiday you want to enjoy here. As far as cost is concerned, there are two ways of doing this: budget and luxury.So basically, there are two types of islands here: private and public. The public islands, also called “local islands”, are those inhabited, meaning there are locals living there. This also means that there are establishments available to everyone such as grocery stores, tour agencies, shops, etc. The private islands are usually occupied by luxury resorts, most of which are open only to their guests and staff. Some of these private islands are open to non-guests who are staying elsewhere but on a day tour.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>The Northern Lights, also called Aurora Borealis, can only be seen in the northern hemisphere and is strongest above the Arctic Circle (60-degree latitude) like in Northern Norway.It was named Aurora Borealis by Galileo as far back as 1619 after Aurora – the Roman goddess of dawn, and Boreas – the Greek name for the north wind.The Northern Lights are created when solar wind packed with charged particles come into Earths magnetosphere.

The charged particles, mainly electrons, and protons, get precipitated into the upper atmosphere where their energy is lost causing emitting of colored lights. This emitted light is what we see here down at Earth as Northern Lights.</p>

      <h3><b>AMSTERDAM</b></h3>
      <h5>Getting Around in Amsterdam    <span class="w3-opacity">October 28, 2018</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Amsterdam has impressive public transportation and offers travelers bicycles, metros, buses, ferries and trains to help you get around the city and beyond. Getting around Amsterdam is also very cheap, just a Euro or two per ride, so you have lots of options!

Bicycle: Most locals use bikes to get around. There are a LOT of bicycles, so be prepared for lots of bike traffic, but you can easily rent one (for about $10-12 Euros) for your time there.

Helpful Tip: As a pedestrian, cyclists have the right of way– so watch out!

Walking: Most places you’ll want to visit in Amsterdam are relatively close together. Obviously a bus or metro will get you around much quicker though.

Public Transport: You’ll find that getting around quickest can take a combination of bus, metro and tram rides. Luckily, the GVB offers daily transportation passes, available for 1 to 7 days, with prices starting from €7.50 Euros, and are valid for use on all three types of transport. This is definitely your best best if you’re in the city for a few days.</p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>I really think you can go anytime. However, winter is LOVELY because you really will avoid the crowds. I remember waiting half an hour to go inside the Notre Dame in July, while in January there was no wait. But I will say, going in the spring and summer is lovely because flowers are blooming. Places like Monet’s Gardens and Versailles are going to be lush with flowers everywhere.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
 <p> 1. Ammoudi Bay — I suggest heading down to Ammoudi for a leisurely afternoon starting with lunch. Around the corner is Agios Nikolaos rock, which is a great spot for cliff diving and sunbathing. Facing the water, head left down the path past the restaurants until you see it!</p>
<p>2. Red Beach — this unique red sand beach is situated at the bottom of the island. My tip: go in the late afternoon once the crowds have cleared, for a sunset dip. Note: many beaches on Santorini are rocky, so don’t be afraid to lounge rather than swim.</p>
<p>3. Fira Town — lined with boutiques overlooking the ocean, it’s easy to spend an afternoon here wandering the quaint streets and hunting for products from local designers.</p>
<p>4. Byzantine Castle Ruins – for beautiful views of Oia and beyond, I suggest visiting this spot and exploring the beautiful winding streets nearby.</p>
<p>5. Perissa Black Sand Beach — this beach is famous for its black sand. There are also plenty of nearby tavernas where you can grab lunch and go back to soaking up the sun.</p>

      <h3><b>NEW YORK CITY</b></h3>
      <h5>TOP CITY VIEWS    <span class="w3-opacity">November 11, 2018</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>The observation deck of the Empire State Building might be New York’s most iconic viewpoint, but it’s pricey at $54 to go right up to the 102nd floor. The Top of the Rock viewpoint at the Rockerfeller Centre might not be quite as tall but it’s a bit more reasonable at $36 and you get the bonus of a great view of the Empire State Building while you’re up there.

Or get a drink to go with your view at one of the city’s rooftop bars. Many are attached to fancy hotels, so you have to fork out for a room or run the gauntlet of bouncers and cover charges. But 230 Fifth has a big roof terrace bar on Fifth Avenue that’s open to anyone. It’s the city’s largest rooftop patio, overlooking the Empire State Building with patio heaters and blankets in winter.</p>

      <h5>Best Time to go to Mount Fuji for the Weather  <span class="w3-opacity">November 15, 2018</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Because Japan is a country which has four seasons, the visitors can get a good view of Mount Fuji that changes every time. A combination of the peak and cherry blossoms can be seen during the spring and one can enjoy climbing the mountain without snow.

Red and orange leaves can be seen on and around the mountain in autumn creating beautiful picturesque scenery. Last but not the least, the snow will be seen covering the whole mountain during the winter, which reveals the most famous views or pictures of Mount Fuji.

Apart from the summer months, temperatures at the peak are usually below freezing with the average temperatures falling around 19°F (-7°C ). Although the summer months are warmer it can still be rather cold and even get freezing temperatures.</p>

      <h5>Why visit Marina Bay Sands SkyPark? <span class="w3-opacity">November 18, 2018</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Marina Bay Sands is easily one of the most recognisable buildings from Singapore. Opened in 2010, the hotel & casino resort stands on the waterfront of Marina Bay and was claimed as the most expensive standalone casino property in the world. The building consists of three tapering towers (55 storey high) that are crowned with a giant 1 hectare skypark. The skypark hosts an infinite swimming pool, gardens, and jogging paths. This makes the skypark at Marina Bay Sands not just an attraction for those staying at the hotel, but also for locals and tourists visiting the country.</p>

      <p>Honolulu, Hawaii needs little introduction — it offers a beautiful, sunny beach vacation for visitors from northern climes, but as the capital of Hawaii, it also offers so much more in terms of the arts, culture, shopping and nightlife.

Only in Honolulu will you be able to swim at an idyllic beach, visit the only royal palace in the U.S., have your pick of dim sum, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai or Hawaiian food for lunch, and in the evening, go salsa dancing, clubbing, or listen to live jazz — all in one day.</p>

  <p ALIGN = CENTER >Baguio Colleges, as the University of the Cordilleras was earlier known, pioneered in tertiary education in the mountain highlands of the Cordillera  region <br>
  amidst devastation in and around Baguio City after the Second World War.Despite a pessimistic outlook and the bleak prospects pervading the climate<br> 
of any undertaking at that time, Atty. Benjamin R. Salvosa envisioned Baguio City as a university town. With such vision, he undauntedly pursued a noble <br>
 mission by founding a college. It was on June 19, 1946, coinciding with the birth anniversary of Dr. Jose P. Rizal, that a historic event unfolded. Baguio Colleges <br>
 was established initially offering courses in teacher training and liberal arts, with the first batch of enrollees consisting of 156 students. Classes were first held<br>
 in rented spaces at the Antipolo building, and later, at the Lopez and Lamping buildings along Session Road, the city's main thoroughfare.1966 became a turning point <br>
 for Baguio Colleges as it was converted into an educational foundation. Since then, it has blazed new trails and has become more responsive to the needs of the time.<br>

The founder, Atty. Benjamin R. Salvosa sat as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and held the reins of the presidency up to the early part of 1994.<br>

Through the years, the University of the Cordilleras has grown bigger through the offering of additional courses and increasing student enrollment.<br> 
It continues to grow even better with time, as evidenced by exemplary performance in various fields of discipline, with its graduates shining in national<br> 
licensure examinations, and its alumni doing well in private employment, in the practice of their trade and profession, and in public service.<br>
Today, the University of the Cordilleras caters to more than 15,000 students coming from the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR), Regions I and II,<br>
 as well as from neighboring provinces in Luzon. Course offerings range from graduate studies, law, arts and sciences, nursing, engineering and architecture, <br>
 commerce and secretarial, teacher education, computer science, technical courses, elementary and high school.The University's College of Law is rated among<br> 
 the top law schools in the country, having graduated bar topnotchers as of year 2007. The Colleges of Engineering, Criminology, Information and Computer Science, <br>
 and Teacher Education have gained recognition as among the top colleges in the region and the country. The College of Nursing, although newly-opened, <br>
 has already shown an optimistic outlook with its exceptional performance in its first ever nursing board examinations.The future looks bright for the<br>
 University of the Cordilleras, and we're glad to be blessed to serve these mountain highlands of the Philippines. Mabuhay!</p>
